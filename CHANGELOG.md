## Update 1.56
- Dev nitty gritty (these shouldn't be in B.net changelog)
  - Moved to Saved As Components.
  - Moved changelog out of Triggers for usability.
  - Inverted order of changelog, don't need to scroll through old stuff. Also culled nigh-decade old comments that no longer seem relevant.

## Update 1.55
- Gabriel
  - Now has 100 max energy (down from 150), with the same energy regeneration.
  - Holy Storm now costs 30 energy (down from 50).
  - Holy Storm now instantly kills Hell's lesser demons (Demons, Imps, Devils).
- The Tie Vote may no longer be activated during the pre-game phase.

## Update 1.54
### Balance
- Endgame Reinforcements
  - Heaven receives more reinforcements when God arrives (roughly 6 of each elite).
  - Reinforcements at the Throne now spawn spread out.
  - Heaven now receives periodic reinforcements at the Throne of Heaven once God has arrived (roughly 2 of each elite).
  - Hell no longer receives periodic reinforcements once God has arrived.
- God
  - Now deals 50% damage to units under Dark Swarm (up from 10% damage).
  - Weapon now called Judgment Beam (changed from Rift Beam).
- Infernal Protectors
  - Now deal Melee damage (changed from Ranged damage).
  - Now self-heal at a rate of 2 (up from 0.2734).
- Nathaniel no longer has a random delay on his transformations (maximum 0.0 seconds down from maximum 0.5 seconds).
- Angel subgroup priority is now 20 (down from 50). This means they will appear later in the list of selected units.
- Holyfire subgroup priority is now 10 (down from 80).
- The region where the Benediction Wall kills lesser demons has been expanded to properly cover the affected area.

### Features
- Pre-game
  - 0-star players may no longer push 1-star players off of Zadkiel or Moloch.
  - The Admin rank has been removed for now.
- Custom control groups have been further optimized.

### Bugfixes
- An error in the code caused flying Asmodeus to receive a smaller range bonus from Sammyazza than grounded Asmodeus. This has been fixed.
- Duma's Guardian Shield tooltip typo fixed.

### Misc
- The -spawn god command in Sandbox now causes the timer to disappear and for God to spawn at the Throne of Heaven (instead of Heaven's Gate).

## 1.50-1.53
- Hotfix: Custom control groups should now properly save to and load from players' bank files.
